Smart Pantry
Smart pantry is an application that will keep track of the groceries that are bought
from any grocery store by its customers. The solution is that all grocery items are kept
track within a user's pantry, notifies the user if a specific grocery item is close to 
expiration, or has expired on a calendar, how much a user has spend on groceries for that 
specific week, as well as keeping track of how much groceries are currently within a 
user's pantry. 

Smart Pantry includes the following features:

- Generates a list of grocery items that a user can add to their shopping list
- Users can add / remove items from existing pantry
- View upcoming expiration dates of grocery items
- Users can create their own list of grocery items for their shopping list
- Users can view through different pantry items
